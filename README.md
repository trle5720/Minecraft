ABOUT THIS PROJECT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is about Minecraft. Minecraft is real world game on the market. It is an 
open world, free-to-play, and likely the most popular indie game.

We modeled this game after dungeons and dragons, but we plastered the Minecraft theme 
everywhere. The goal of the game is to fight and beat the Ender Dragon, but be wary, 
the dragon is very strong and deadly. Players are advised to gather resources, fight 
mobs, trade and craft for other goodies in order to help their fight against the dragon. 

Another game element players should know about is xp. Experience is given when the 
players amass resources for their dragon fight. The more xp you have, the more 
resources you have gathered. To provide players some challenge, we rank the high scores 
by lowest amount of xp used to beat the dragon, and these rankings can be accessed 
when the player wins the game. 

The last game mechanic players should know about is that mobs respawn with full hp 
if you choose to fight them after failing to kill them. All mobs spawn at random when 
interacted with and only drop their resource 70% of the time.

Players should input only one character in this game when playing unless prompted otherwise.
